Maze Generation problem
The challenge this month is to create an algorithm in Scala to automatically generate a maze or series of mazes.

There are a number of algorithms that can be used to automatically generate a maze.  A maze can be generated by starting with a predetermined starting point, then constructing the maze along a path.

Examples of maze generation algorithms are available at the Wikipeida page:
